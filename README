# DistSystsPerformanceModeling

This code has been written in order to predict the performance of a distributed system depending on the deployment of its entities on a given architecture. 

Currently, the only distributed system that is described is UpRight (UpRight Cluster Services - SOSP 2009).

Using this code one can:
- specify the architecture the distributed system will run on 
- specify the distributed system considered in terms of communications and computations
- obtain the throughput of the system for a given deployment, or find the best deployment

Constructive comments are welcome.
